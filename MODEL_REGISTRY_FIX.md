# Model Registry Error - Final Resolution

## Issue Summary
**Error**: `TypeError: Model 'escalator_lite.ticket' does not exist in registry.`

## Root Cause Identified
The error was caused by **incorrect model loading order** in the module initialization.

### Problem Details
1. **Dependency Chain**: The `escalator_sla.py` file contains a class `TicketInheritSLA` that inherits from `escalator_lite.ticket`
2. **Wrong Load Order**: In `models/__init__.py`, modules were being loaded in this order:
   ```python
   from . import escalator_category  # References escalator_lite.ticket in computed field
   from . import escalator_sla       # Contains inheritance from escalator_lite.ticket  
   from . import escalator_ticket    # Defines escalator_lite.ticket
   ```
3. **Registry Failure**: When Odoo tried to load `escalator_sla`, it attempted to inherit from `escalator_lite.ticket` before that model was registered in the system.

## Solution Applied
**Fixed the model loading order** in `models/__init__.py`:

```python
# CORRECTED ORDER
from . import res_users
from . import escalator_stage
from . import escalator_team
from . import escalator_ticket     # ✓ Load base model FIRST
from . import escalator_category   # ✓ Load dependent models after
from . import escalator_sla        # ✓ Load inheritance models last
```

### Why This Fixes The Issue
1. **Base Model First**: `escalator_lite.ticket` is now registered before any models try to reference or inherit from it
2. **Dependencies Resolved**: When `escalator_category` loads and its computed field references `escalator_lite.ticket`, the model exists
3. **Inheritance Works**: When `TicketInheritSLA` tries to inherit from `escalator_lite.ticket`, the base model is already in the registry

## Validation Results
✅ **Model dependency order validated**  
✅ **All XML files valid**  
✅ **All Python syntax valid**  
✅ **Module structure correct**  
✅ **All enhancements preserved**  

## Technical Notes
- This is a common issue in Odoo when models have circular or forward dependencies
- The order in `__init__.py` determines the sequence of model registration
- Models must be loaded before they can be referenced or inherited from
- The fix maintains all the enhanced functionality we added

## Expected Result
The `escalator_lite.ticket` model registry error should now be completely resolved, and the module should load successfully in Odoo 12.
